This project includes six source files: 
RunExperiments.java, Graph.java, Edge.java, Vertex.java, Pair.java, and DisjointSet.java. 
Functions computeMST and recomputeMST are in RunExperiments.java.
To run it, keep the directory structure and run the shell script runTest.sh at this MST folder. 
Compiling is included in the shell script. 
Output would be write to results folder.
